                        <u>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch.</u> The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. <mark>Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes.</mark> <strong>With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.</strong>

                                Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.[c] Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.[16][17] An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400 BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens[15] appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy.[18] Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game harpastum. Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football.[19][20][21][22][23][24] As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.

                                        <span style="color:#84f187;font-size:15px;">The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference.</span> The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout.
